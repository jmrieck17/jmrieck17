### ðŸ‘‹ Hello There,


My name is Joshua Rieck, and I am a recent graduate of [Wayne State University](https://wayne.edu/) in Detroit, Michigan where I obtained a masters degree in Data Science and Business Analytics. Through my program of study, I learned advanced analytics techniques such as data visualization, data mining techniques, and machine learning using SQL, R programming and Python. I am also working on teaching myself to use Tensorflow for deep learning techniques. If you are interested in learning more about Wayne State's Data Science program, click [here](https://engineering.wayne.edu/data-science-program).

I am a self-motivated, enthusiastic, eager learner who loves to continuously build on my skillset in my free time. A link to my LinkedIn profile can be found below:
