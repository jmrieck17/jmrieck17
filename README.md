## ðŸ‘‹ Hello There,

My name is Joshua Rieck, and I am from metro Detroit, Michigan where I recently graduated with my master's degree in Data Science and Business Analytics from [Wayne State University](https://wayne.edu/). Through my program of study, I learned advanced analytics techniques such as data visualization, data mining techniques, and machine learning using SQL, R programming, and Python. I am also working on teaching myself to use Tensorflow for deep learning techniques. If you are interested in learning more about Wayne State's Data Science program, click [here](https://engineering.wayne.edu/data-science-program).

## Professional Summary

I am a data science and business analytics graduate with a passion for solving complex problems through data-driven insights. My expertise lies in data visualization, data mining, and machine learning, with proficiency in SQL, R, and Python. I am dedicated to continuous learning and am currently expanding my knowledge in deep learning with TensorFlow.
